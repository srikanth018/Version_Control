Task -8 Explanation

1. Creating a Pre-Commit Hook
I created a `pre-commit` hook script in `.git/hooks/` and ensured it was executable.
The script was as follows:

TARGET_FILE="File1.txt"
STAGED_FILE=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

if echo "$STAGED_FILE" | grep -q "$TARGET_FILE"; then
    echo "The modified file is $TARGET_FILE"
else
    echo "The modified file is not $TARGET_FILE"
    echo "Aborting commit..."
    exit 1
fi

echo "The modified file is $STAGED_FILE"

This script checks whether `File1.txt` is modified before allowing a commit.

2. Testing the Pre-Commit Hook
After writing the script, I attempted to commit changes:

 git add .
 git commit -m "test aborting commit using hook"

The script successfully identified files that were modified and prevented the commit if `File1.txt` was not among them.


3. Final Testing
I tested the hook again, verifying it blocked commits when necessary and allowed them when conditions were met.

output 1:

PS E:\Presidio Assignments\Version_Control> git commit -m "After writing pre commit hook"
The modified file is File1.txt
The modified file is task-08/File1.txt
